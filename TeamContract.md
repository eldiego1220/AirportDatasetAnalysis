# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** Our team will meet once a week every Friday at 3:00 pm. We will discuss the work completed for the week and outline the tasks that need to be done for the following week in a SCRUM format.

2. **Assistance** Everyone will be available through the team Discord chat where we will be able to work through issues that come up. A response will be given within 24 hours.

3. **Respect** During the weekly meeting, everyone is encouraged to speak their opinions on the progress as well as the direction of the project. Any decisions will be decided with a simple majority, and the decisions will be made by taking into account any obstacles brought up by each members.

## Collaboration

1. **Work Distribution** Each week, the necessary delivarables for the week will be determined by the full team. The tasks will be divided according to preference, and randomization if no preference. Unforseen disruptions will be discussed as a team and extra manpower will be allocated if necessary to ensure sucess.

2. **Time Commitment** To ensure an equal distribution of work, each member will take on tasks such that they spend a minimum of 3 hours each week working towards the project. If a task proves more difficult than previously envisioned, any available team members will aid in the task. If a team member is consistently not meeting time commitment goals, a group discussion will be had, and if necessary, a meeting with our mentor.

3. **Conflict Resolution** All conflicts within the team will be decided according to the majority. Each member understands that the other members have commitments outside of this class, but if commitment to the project is hindered on numerous occasions, the team will discuss how to break the tasks into more managable parts during busy weeks. If commitment is still an issue, a mentor discussion will be necessary.
