### Comments
Well written proposal overall, with two minor flaws.

**Leading Question**
The leading question is succint, and understandable.

**Dataset**
The dataset is well described and the intuition on the efficiency of runtime and storage are good (although we will see alternatives which are better in some contexts). Minor flaw: The storage complexity is not quite clear, what is n in O(n)? Please express in terms of V or E.

**Algorithm**
The algorithms are well described. One minor flaw: the complexity described for Dijkstra in the proposal is achieved by using constructs like Fibonacci heap. You may want to explore the expected reasonable complexity based on the data structures you would be using.
